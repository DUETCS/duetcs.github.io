Who doesn't want to be Sherlock the freaking Holmes? Oh dear, I played, pretended so much of being him, sometimes my coincidental correct deductions made me feel high. Meanwhile, I've learnt a cool trick. We literally can know about thirty percent of a person who we don't know anything about by performing this act.

**Theory**: The theory is, Google adsense shows you personalized ads. Cool enough? It shows you ads based on your recent searches and other online activities. Means, if you're a person who is deciding which university to admit to and been searching for universities on Google for a while, Google will show you the ads of the universities on every webpages that you visit to that has Google adsense turned on.

So, if I ask you, "Hey Mr, my mobile data is finished and I need to check a website to see whether that restaurant is open today. Can I have your phone to check that please?" and you become nice and give the phone to me, bang! All I need to do is to visit some random websites to check the ads and youtube's homepage.

I can know if you or someone you care about have diabetes or AIDs. I can know if you've been planning to travel lately. I can know if you're a med student or an engineering one. I can know which tools you use the most or planning to use. I can know if you're suicidal or not. That's enough information about a stranger without asking about them. Cool.

Note: Keep your youtube and browser app locked if you want not to leak such information of yourself.
