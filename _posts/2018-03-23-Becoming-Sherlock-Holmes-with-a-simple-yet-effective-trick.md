Who doesn't want to be Sherlock the freaking Holmes? Oh dear, I played, pretended so much of being him, sometimes my coincidental correct deductions made me feel high.

The basic idea is, somehow take someone's phone and just check the homepage of Youtube. You're done. It contains videos the person is fond of, topics he likes, the music and movie genre, what kind of academic videos he watches which will be helpful to determine in which department he is studying and much more.

The point of the post is, someone might take your phone and find out almost everything about you just by knowing your preference of videos on Youtube. You should be alarmed about that. If you don't like other people to know more about you, lock your phone or Google apps.
