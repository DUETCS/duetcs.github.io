You're not the center of the universe, the world doesn't revolve around you. No one cares what shirt you're wearing, or if you've bought the best shoes you could afford. Let ourselves be fed some examples.

You hear a lot of things on the news. A random guy died in a car accident today. How did that make you feel? Maybe a bit of sympathy and a bit of curiosity about the guy, nothing more. You forget about it two minutes later. We all do. We're designed this way. The same logic applies, if you die today, not much happens to the universe and to people around you except a few of those who cares about you.

So, what's the point of all of these? life, study, education, love, emotions? It ends anyway. Maybe instead of caring what will happen, thinking about present and caring what we do, experiences we're making right now is worth the attention. That's what makes us happy, isn't it?

So, to have a kind of fulfill life in the present, we need to develop ourselves a bit, to get along with this cruel world.

* <b>Learn to be tough when you need to.</b> No one listens to you if you don't know how to tough at the appropriate time. You can't be a good leader, you can't stand for your yourself and friends when you need to.

* <b>Go to the gym, strong body matters.</b> If you're a man, being tough without a good physique might not come in handy. A few unfair advantages you can have with a good physique: 
	
	1. Save yourself and nearby victims from hijackers and such people.
	2. Might save a girl from being raped, who knows.
	3. Impress people you would never get to know which might doesn't matter to you but spreads positive vibration in the air.
	4. You stay confident, life's goooood (a few more o's for emphasizing purposes).
	5. Care less about bullsh*t, negativity can't get to you.

* <b>Keep the promise you make to yourself.</b> This might not seem much of a big deal but trust me, this is the most important reason why most of the students and entrepreneurs end up being unsuccessful. If you promise to yourself that you'll finish the homework tonight but procrastinate instead, you'll be depressed and within a few days, you'll have hard time being happy. Please don't break the promises you make to yourself (urge to the reader and to me, telling my future self because I might need to get back to this article in the future for my own good.)

* <b>Eat healthy.</b> You're what you eat. You're what you poop.

* <b>Know a few time management skills.</b> You need to be on time in 21st century. Late people sometimes annoys us, sometimes.

* <b>Help others and never ever underestimate networking.</b> If you keep helping people around you, you make them feel that they owe you a favor which will come in handy in time when you need it the most, trust me. Keep up meeting new people. It helps. It really helps. Just like your physics teacher made you the best in the class whom you got to know by a friend of one of your best friend.
