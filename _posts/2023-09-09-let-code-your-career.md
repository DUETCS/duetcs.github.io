On September 09, 2023, DUETCS arranged a career talk, hosted by <a href="">Taufik Hasan</a>, with Programming Hero. There were questions on their journey from DUET to the software industry and discussions on the software industry interview process, problem solving and growth mindset, resilience, and other core CS graduate skills. Moderator of the DUET Computer Society, Assistant Professor Imran Masud sir, also presented this session.
It was a nice networking opportunity, and the audience had the option to ask direct questions. Guests were nice and humble and provided their LinkedIn for further progression.
