Before internet, we needed to read a lot of books. We still do but my philosophy is to take the MOOC first for a certain subject and if I find that interesting, then dive into the books. MOOCs are good as introductory overview of a particular subject. Below are the MOOCs I think everyone should take, as well as it'll be my personal list for the MOOCs that I'll take.
