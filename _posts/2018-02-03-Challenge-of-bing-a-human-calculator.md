So I was in market today and bought a few fishes and had to calculate the price in my head. At first, it seemed like I needed to use calculator. Then I started playing with multiplications on my head.

In the meantime, I realized, it's possible to be a human calculator. Some people has already been there. It just need a bit of effort. And the day I put hundred percent effort begins from today. Cool. I will post updates.
