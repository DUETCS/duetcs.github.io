Okay, so I was in a village market today and bought a few fishes and had to calculate the price in my head. At first, it seemed like I needed to check calculator. Then I started playing with multiplications on my head.

Then I realized, it's possible to be a human calculator. It needs a bit of effort. And the day I put hundred percent effort begins from today. Cool. I will post updates. 

Till then, take care.
