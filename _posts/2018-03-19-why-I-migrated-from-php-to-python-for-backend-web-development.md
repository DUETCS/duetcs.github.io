We already are tired of telling machines what to do. That's why we see the trend of machine learning and AI in 21<sup>st</sup> century. We're trying to teach machines how to think, Alan Turing wanted so too.

As a CSE student and a web developer with keen interest in machine learning, I had to change my technology stack. I migrated from windows to Linux. I used to code PHP a lot. Then I learned python, because all the development on machine learning is happening around python. I sometimes might access a Machine Learning model through REST aPI If I use python in back-end. Tons of beautiful libraries are being built and developed everyday in python.

PHP will stay for web development purpose, but as I'm learning Machine Learning so two birds in one stone for me.
