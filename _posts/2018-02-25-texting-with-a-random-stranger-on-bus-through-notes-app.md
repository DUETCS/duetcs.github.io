Recently, I've watched a TED-Talk about rejections. It moved me so much that I've started looking for rejections here and there too. And this talk will always be on my all time favorite TED-Talk list. Watch the talk for a great lesson regardless of your age.

#### What I did:

I was on a pub bus yesterday and found a girl sitting next to me who looked 2-3 years older, looked smart, kind of stressed and lonely. And I wanted to ask where she was studying but the bus was loud. So I opened my Notes app and wrote this (Screenshot below) and passed my phone to her without saying a single word. Note that we were total stranger to each other.

I was a bit embarrassed first. And Bangladeshi girls are not very open to strangers and some of them are used to slapping boys on public, so I had to think about the consequences. I was checking the vibe of the air, it felt good and I had gone with my instincts.

Basically, I just complimented her. BUET is a good University here and I just asked if she were on BUET.

She grabbed my phone being confused, looked at the screen, read my message and started typing. Thanks god, nothing gone wrong, I was expecting a rejection though. She passed my phone back to me after a while. She typed:

I took my phone and wanted to write something again to her. But I saw embarrassment and she was trying to sleep right away. I thought, "okay, that's enough girl, you look embarrassed, trying to escape a stranger and I should not write to you anymore." So my first interaction with a total stranger through my notes app stopped there. We just sat there without any interactions until our destinations.

I feel like I'll do this again. Would look for rejections. I need a lot to learn, to stop even a bit of inferiority complex, without being over confident. 

Start your own experiments then. You'll learn a lot, I promise.
