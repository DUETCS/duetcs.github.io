Even though we are at university, knowing a bit of good English is always something to be proud of here in Bangladesh because most of us aren't fluent at speaking it with with standard accents.

The university is up and running and I'm just trying to get started with my studies. I usually sit at one of the last benches where I've always felt comfortable. Yesterday, I was meeting a new guy and I noticed that he was folding his two fingers while handshaking, like the way metal fans raise their hand sign. I asked why right away. He replied that he was being unique. Okay, cool. Enough information to spot a show off along with random frequent English lame slangs. I wanted to play with him by pretending a normal 'khet' (not classy) guy.

Professor was in the class so I ripped a bit of page from my notebook and wrote, "I want to be <u>unik</u> too" and passed that to him and concentrated on the class.

I wanted to see how he reacted to that misspelling. A few moments later, he passed me that back writing, "You've already become unique by misspelling unique". And he corrected my spelling too. 

But I couldn't understand if he was being mean or just joking. So I wanted to check that by passing an another message.

This time, I wrote, "Give me some <u>tip</u> to do well in English." This time, I could smell something fun was going to happen.

Hell yeah, he was being mean. Finally, spotted an asshole in the class. He said something like:

<p class="message">
    1. First learn the spelling of tips. <br>
    2. Figure out problems and solve them. <br>
    3. Why bother learning English anyway, just decrease the use of English words.
</p>

The first two tips was good. But whoa, the third one, damn, that hurt, made me feel something, I don't know, a bit of feeling you get by winning and a bit of feeling that you get when you get dumped, it was a mixed of that. Yet, I didn't let him know what was going through my mind. I stayed put and pretended as I was being humiliated to give him more pleasure.

But the fun things aside, it got me thinking. I ask for help a lot on the things that I'm not good at. What if I was asking for help from him too. Man, it got me rethink whom to ask help to. 

Nevertheless, I guess learning is fun so I will not stop asking for help from people. And I will not stop playing, ever. People are fun. Have a good day!
