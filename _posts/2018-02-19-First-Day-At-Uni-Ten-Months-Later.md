After completing Diploma in Engineering, we had two options. Either prepare for the university admission or seek jobs around. Initially I was in dilemmas. I needed a job yet I wanted to be in a public university which usually takes a bit of extra preparation and hard work.

If one chooses to prepare for the university, s/he must take that as a first priority. Which means, less coding and for that, one might lose his technical skills a bit after a few months. It's something I had to sacrifice. I coded in `PHP` back then. I had to stop coding for four months due to admission process. And I never coded PHP after that. I migrated to `Python` for web development and I never looked back. I will write an article about why I migrated.

In my first day, I fully concentrated on the library and the classmates. The first thing I did was to check the collection of the books which fortunately made my day, a few important books from my 'read later' list were missing though. I didn't find any literature books, all of them were technical. I know it's an Engineering University, but no literature books, seriously?

Now the classmates part. Out of 60, I only knew three, I met them when I was in a coaching center preparing for the admission test. One of them were **Rabbi** (Pictured below) my close friend because we shared a lot of common interest on music and TV series.

#### Next quest

My next quest would be to look for entrepreneur classmates. Because, I know, if I start my own startup someday, someone from them might be a co-founder of that.

In the end, first day wasn't bad. Met few great nerdy Homo Sapience and few fun ones. And as always, my favorite spot were one of the last benches. Started liking a few professors there who did teach the way I wanted to be taught, perfect! 

Hope this journey of four years turns out to be a life changing journey and I will do anything to make it so. **Hasta la vista.**
