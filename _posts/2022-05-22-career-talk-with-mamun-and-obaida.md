On 12nd May, 2022, DUETCS arranged a career talk, hosted by <a href="https://ovebepari.github.io">Ove Bepari</a>, with guests, DUET Alumni, Abdullah Al Mamun (SE, ML, Meta) and Abu Obaida (SDE, Amazon). There were questions on their journey from DUET to Big Tech and discussions on big tech interview process, problem solving and growth mindset, resillience and other core CS graduate skills. 

It was a nice networking opportunity and the audience had the options to ask direct questions. Guests were nice and humble and provided their LinkedIn for further progression.

Good luck!
