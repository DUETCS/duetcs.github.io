Few weeks ago (on 27th June, 2018, first live contest on Codeforces) I started Sports Programming. I've been coding for a while and building stuffs I needed (like chrome extensions, file sharing server etc) and while making an efficient file compressor for myself, I came to know that I needed more algorithmic skills. Which can be learned but without any proper practice, usually it'd take a lot of time to code and implement is what I concluded.

So here I am, thinking I'm a more or less smarter than average but while solving some easy problems, that I think I should've solved easily took two-three hours and often more. This, this incident shook me. What was I thinking? I overestimated myself.

So this is the Second year, First semester and I look forward to have a somewhat self-satisfactory profile-graph on Codeforces and I hope I'd work hard enough for that.

It's crazy how wrong you can be sometimes about yourself!
