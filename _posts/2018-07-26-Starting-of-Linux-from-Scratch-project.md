<i>Update, a year or so later: I've grown over the years. It really doesn't make any sense to compile an OS with ubuntu's mirror package servers. I've explored the path and I'm kinda happy that I learnt how all that works but i'd never say, mommy, I made an OS. It doesn't work like that. Shout out to all the people contributing to Open Source. Thank you <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors>Official Archive Mirrors for Ubuntu</a>, you people make the world a better place.</i>

I fell in love with GNU/Linux the 366th day I installed it on my system. It took a year because of the learning curve that seemed a bit steep for me and coming from Windows and a Graphic Design hyped month that I was having at that moment. But being a full time web-developer, I couldn't go back to Windows ever again, I felt the need to stay. I love the existence of the idea of GNU and Linux.

So many things had changed since. I migrated to Python from PHP, stopped Graphic Designing totally, fell in love with a few scripting languages (Bash and Python mostly), started participating on programming contests on various platforms, learned to ask too basic questions which are hard to answer in detail(How does javascript handles playing audio in the browser?).

Speaking of basic questions, I started asking how does Linux kernel and GNU/Linux work and stepped into a project called "Linux from Scratch" which helps devs (Script junkies?) to make their own distro from the Linux Kernel. So far, it's been good. Loving it. It always feel good to be the person in charge of the tools that we use everyday.

### Expectations:
* I do expect to have the knowledge of how an OS really work.
* How to make backward-compatible codes which I feel is pretty important.
* How to maintain open-source projects, by starting one on GitHub, thus learning C++.
* How to make an existing Open Source Software more efficient by the DS and Algs I know.
* Expect to think a bit like Linux Torvalds, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie at the end.

### Goals:
* To make a distribution for my University which will concentrate on simplicity to use, real-time notification system from Uni's website(which is the easiest task of them all) and a few more things.

For now, I feel like I need to spend a bit more time on DS and Algs and need to be natural on it by practicing on coding contest platforms. I do recommend myself and the reader to stay on track.
