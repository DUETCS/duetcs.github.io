On 20th August, 2023, DUETCS arranged a career talk, hosted by <a href="">Taufik Hasan</a>, with guests, DUET Alumni, Abdus Sattar Shohag (CSE-11th Batch, DUET), Software Engineer at Studydrive in Germany and Naeem al Imran (CSE-18th Batch, DUET), Software Engineer at AppsCode in Bangladesh. There were questions on their journey from DUET to Big Tech and discussions on big tech interview process, problem solving and growth mindset, resillience and other core CS graduate skills. 

It was a nice networking opportunity and the audience had the options to ask direct questions. Guests were nice and humble and provided their LinkedIn for further progression.
