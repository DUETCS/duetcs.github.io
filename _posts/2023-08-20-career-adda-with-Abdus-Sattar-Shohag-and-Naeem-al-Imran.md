On August 20, 2023, DUETCS arranged a career talk, hosted by <a href="">Taufik Hasan</a>, with guests, DUET alumni Mohammed Abdus Sattar (CSE-11th Batch, DUET), a software engineer at Studydrive in Germany, and MD NAEEM AL IMRAN (CSE-18th Batch, DUET), a software engineer at AppsCode in Bangladesh. There were questions on their journey from DUET to the software industry and discussions on the software industry interview process, problem solving and growth mindset, resilience, and other core CS graduate skills. Moderator of the DUET Computer Society, Assistant Professor Imran Masud sir, also presented this session.
It was a nice networking opportunity, and the audience had the option to ask direct questions. Guests were nice and humble and provided their LinkedIn for further progression.
