Being expert in a field takes time these days. There was a time when people could contribute to Science, Philosophy, Mathematics, Religion, Psychology and yet live a few decades more but we live in an era when the tree of knowledge has broader branches. It takes time to ride on one branch and to find the end of it. It is really hard to contribute to several branches of knowledge now because we don't live that much. This idea has made people think.

### A Thought on Programming
Yes, I believe the idea that everyone should learn to code too but we're getting in an era where we don't use the same tools for more that two years average. Which is making us 'not very expert' in a programming language or a tool. Besides programming skills aren't that important after you know programming. It's the problem that needs to be solved in a particular way which is important but sometimes you can't do that because you have a boss and you need to earn money and you have to follow his orders which might not be the best way to do things. I recommend taking a look at this article below:

For now this will be an unfinished article, hope to complete it soon. Ending it with a Quora answer, will add a few maybe.
