First of all, greetings. And gratitude to **Github pages** for allowing me to host this blog free of any cost. Cool.

I used disqus to enable comments.

I used jekyll for my blog. And I wanted to be minimal as possible so used lynon theme, but it's a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/willdurand/willdurand.github.com).

Jekyll is a tool for transforming your plain text into static websites and blogs. It is simple, static, and blog-aware. Jekyll uses the Liquid templating language and has builtin Markdown and Textile support.

It also ties in nicely to Github Pages.
