Graph Algorithms.

The day you start solving problems modeling on Graphs, is the day you realize how powerful a computer can be, or rather how poweful you can be onece you learn how to implement abstract ideas. Graph is abstract, in fact, real but abstract for computers because computer works in a linear fashion. Pointers, my friend. Pointers made everything possible. If Facebook has 2.8 billion users right now, that means 2.8 billions nodes interconnected with relationships. But sir, I can only solve Graph problems that only has 10^6 nodes or so! 2.8 billion is a lot for my **Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2350M CPU @ 2.30GHz** PC.

This 10^6 vs 2.8 billion had punched me hard. I've been thinking and wandering a lot about how I can get started solving that 10^6 node containing problem with 2.8b nodes in mind. And bang, there's a word for it. **S C A L A B I L I T Y**, I've found repository on Github and I think everyone should take a look at <a href="https://github.com/binhnguyennus/awesome-scalability">Github - Awesome Scalability</a>.

Idk, signing off!
