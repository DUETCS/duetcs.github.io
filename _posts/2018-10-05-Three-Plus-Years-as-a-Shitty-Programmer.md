Every new day starts with a feeling like, well, I was a shitty programmer yesterday. It is a good thing, maybe it means I'm growing. So things I used to do on a regular basis that made me a shitty programmer are:

### Used to Memorize Documentations:
Learning `Assembly Programming Language` or understanding how the computer works in a bit level ( [Here's a Link ](https://www.bottomupcs.com/) ) is more important than spending time memorizing documentations of a certain thing. Just look up the doc and code. Save time. Do art and love. Get a life outside of the Matrix.


### Didn't Pay Much Attention to Error Messages:

The initial days of me learning `C` and my attempt to be a native in a GNU/Linux distro didn't turn out well. Until I realized how much I ignored terminal error messages.

It took me three days to solve this issue, had to study a bit of Networking too which is the only good side of it. How silly it sounds now.

### Used Windows. Weird.

### Didn't Care Much about Sleep Cycles and Health:
Where should I begin. Coding till 4 AM one day and sleeping the rest of the day doesn't sound productive at all. Specially not for a student like  me who has classes the next day where I need to be attentive. I know some coders stay up late and end up being productive somehow but that's not me. I'd rather embarrass myself playing football everyday afternoon and have a good night sleep.

### I was too Caught up in the Hype of New Stuffs:
I must say it turned out somewhat beneficial but in the long run, lost some precious hours. I started doing Machine Learning at some point and realized later that I was not the person who just uses TensorFlow but doesn't know how it works behind the scenes. I'd rather learn Mathematics now and concentrate on `C`, `ASSEMBLY` and when I need to maybe will do a bit of ML/AI stuff for personal use but that's for another day.

So, takeaway: First be a shitty programmer. Then don't be shitty programmer. Then be a System Programmer. And don't forget reading [Joel on Software [Link] ](https://www.joelonsoftware.com) everyday!
